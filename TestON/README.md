Welcome to TestON !
-------------------
TestON is a solution that aims to interact with OpenFlow/SDN components and automate the functionality of the components.

TestON is an end to end automation solution for testing the Openflow/SDN components
run across various components in an OpenFlow topology. This solution
aims to provide an automation framework that is not just exhaustive in
coverage, but also makes it easy to debug and author scripts.

Test Launch
------------

In order to run TestON, you must have:

* A Linux 2.6.26 or greater kernel compiled with network namespace support
  enabled (see INSTALL for additional information.)

* Python 2.6 or higher versions.

* Install python package ``configObj``. It can be installed as :

     ```
     $ sudo pip install configObj
     ```

 How to launch a test:

 * Navigate to the ``bin/`` directory which
   resides in the ``TestON/`` directory:

    ```
    $ ./cli.py
    teston> run SAMPstartTemplate_1node
    ```

    or

    ```
    $ ./cli.py run SAMPstartTemplate_1node
    ```
